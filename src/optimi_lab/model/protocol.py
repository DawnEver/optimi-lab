"""D42 -- the L6 protocol: a surrogate is ``fit -> Fitted``; a fitted model is ``predict -> Prediction``.

A :class:`Prediction` is the mean ``(n, k)`` and, when asked for and given, the variance ``(n, k)``
(LATENT: of the mean function, not of a new noisy observation) and the gradient of the mean
``(n, k, d)``. A model declares what it ``gives`` beyond the mean as a set of :class:`Give`; asking
for anything else is refused naming what it does give -- never answered with a placeholder.

Every model sees points as an ``(n, d)`` matrix and values as an ``(n, k)`` matrix, one row per
point, finite. A prediction is a number the caller labels as ``Evidence.PREDICTED``
(:class:`~optimi_lab.archive.Archive` keeps it apart from every observation, B0-08).
