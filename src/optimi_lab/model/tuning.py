"""Surrogate hyper-parameter tuning: every combination of candidate settings, judged by cross-validation.

:func:`tune` builds the surrogate *name* (:data:`~optimi_lab.model.registry.SURROGATES`) at every
point of the Cartesian grid of *candidates*, scores each by the k-fold out-of-fold predictions of
:func:`~optimi_lab.model.validation.cross_validate` under one of
:data:`~optimi_lab.model.validation.SCORES`, and returns every :class:`Trial` beside the best.
``r2`` is maximised, every error score minimised. The folds are the same for every trial (one
*seed*), so trials differ only in their settings. Ties keep the first in grid order.
