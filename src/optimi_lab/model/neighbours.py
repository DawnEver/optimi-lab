"""D52 -- k nearest neighbours regression (Euclidean distance).

``uniform`` averages the k nearest values; ``distance`` weights each by ``1 / distance`` and, at a
query that coincides with training points, returns the mean of those points' values alone. The
prediction is piecewise, so it gives no gradient and no variance.
